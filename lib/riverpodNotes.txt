providers => controllers (encapsulates the state of the widgets which can be accessed in the tree for UI rendering)

we use consumerWidget to use providers

1) simple provider => it only reads doesnt change the state upon changing 

2) watch is equivalent to obs in riverpod we wrap the widgt with consumer it rebuilds the widget when state is being watched

	Consumer (
	builder:(context,ref,child){
	int count = ref.watch(name);
	return container();
	}

	button(
	// incrementing the state which is integer typed on button click 
	ref.read(name.state).state++
	)


3) Future Provider used for async functions 

4) stream provider are used for real time chat apps or real time database which isnt like client server 

5) stateNotifierProvider are used for immutable objects

6) modifiers are of 2 types:
	1) autoDispose which destroys the state when its no longer being used
	2)family is used for getting a unique provider based on external parameters from UI
